# SQL-TermProject
## Overview
This project involves the development and implementation of SQL queries, views, stored procedures, functions, and triggers for a database named TermProject. The database schema resembles a typical retail or supply chain system, containing tables such as Customers, Orders, OrderDetails, Products, Suppliers, Employees, and Shippers.

The project is divided into several sections:

- Section B: Data Retrieval
- Section C: Views and Data Manipulation
- Section D: Functions, Stored Procedures, and Triggers

## Testing
Each function, stored procedure, and trigger includes test statements to verify its functionality. These tests demonstrate:

- Correct Data Retrieval: Ensuring that queries return expected results.
- Data Integrity Enforcement: Validating that triggers prevent invalid data modifications.
- Functional Accuracy: Confirming that stored procedures and functions operate as intended with various input parameters.

## Conclusion
This project showcases advanced SQL programming skills, including:

- Complex Data Retrieval: Crafting queries to answer specific business questions.
- View Creation: Simplifying data access through views.
- Data Manipulation: Performing updates and inserts while maintaining data integrity.
- Procedural Programming: Implementing business logic using functions and stored procedures.
- Data Integrity Enforcement: Using triggers to prevent invalid data entry.
